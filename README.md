I'm a Software Engineer and a lifelong learner. My interests lie in AI/ML/GenAI, Web3, and blockchain.

I've worked in all aspects of software development. I started in software testing to automation development, software engineering in monoliths to modern application development practices, DevOps, and building AI-enabled software using LLMs.
