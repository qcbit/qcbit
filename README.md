I'm a Software Engineer and a lifelong learner. My interests lie in AI/ML/GenAI, Web3, and blockchain.

I've worked in all aspects of software development. I started in software testing to automation development, then software engineering in monoliths to modern application development practices, and DevOps.

I'm available for hire. Take a look at my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lancetruong) and reach out to me.
